# ribbons
 This processing program generates beautiful ribbon- or textile-like structures.
 
 It makes use of the BezierLineClass. So in order ro make this work you need to copy the file bezierLineClass.pde from [BezierLineClass](https://github.com/mattack65/processing---bezierLineClass) into the same directory or into another directory and then make a symlink in the ribbon directory.
