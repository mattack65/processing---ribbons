# ribbons
 This processing program generates beautiful ribbon- or textile-like structures.
 
 It makes use of the BezierLineClass. So in order to make this work you need to copy the file bezierLineClass.pde from [BezierLineClass](https://github.com/mattack65/processing---bezierLineClass) into the same directory or into another directory and then make a symlink in the ribbon directory.
 
You can change the parameters starting around line 20 to change the appearance.
Every time you click the left mouse button, a new image is created.
With the keys "+" and "-" you can increase or decrease the line density
With the middle mouse button you can show and hide the guidelines
With the right mouse button you can save it as an SVG
With "m" you can add some color.

To make an actual animation, you need to un-comment a few lines, but I recommend to play around with the single images first.

It's all very primitive and experimental. It needs a proper interface.
Let me know if you run into any problems.
